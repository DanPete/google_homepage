<h1>Google Homepage Clone with HTML, CSS, and Sass</h1>

This project uses HTML and CSS skills to create a clone of the Google homepage. I tried to do most of it by looking at the design of the Google homepage, but towards the end tried to pull correct sizing and color of elements.

There are two CSS file because I first went through using just CSS then went back and refactored the CSS by using Sass. I left in some unecessary classes because of this. They were helpful with raw CSS, but not needed when using Sass.

Please feel free to provide me any feedback.

Kind regards,

Dan
